First Slide
========================================================
Ever wanted to find the complement of an angle?  

Second Slide
========================================================
Are you sick of subtracting numbers from 90?

Third Slide
========================================================
Now, you won't have to!
All you need is the angle in degrees (Make sure it's between 0 and 90 degrees) and 'Complement App'!

Fourth Slide
=======================================================
Throw your angle in the text box, press submit and, waaahhh-laaaa, there's your angle's complement! 

Fifth Slide
======================================================
Here's how it works.
The ui takes an input from the text box, sends it to the server, and the server calcualtes, then returns the initial angle's complement with this function:

```r
angleComp <- function(angle) 90 - angle
```
